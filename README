RightRides offers women and LGBTQ individuals a free, safe, late night ride home on Friday and Saturday nights from 11:59 PM - 3 AM, (early Saturday or Sunday morning) in 45 NYC neighborhoods across four NYC boroughs. To call for a ride, the dispatch number is (888) 215-SAFE (7233). 

We are creating a web portal for RightRides dispatchers to connect them with navigators (who sit alongside the RightRides drivers and communicate with the dispatcher) to facilitate information regarding pick-up/drop-off of passengers.

Dispatchers need to be able to:
- Input rider name and address info when they receive a call
   - app should record call time, add rider to spreadsheet/db
- Assign a car to a rider
   - app should notify navigator
- Text a navigator
- View map of rider and driver locations
- Click on rider to view info
- Click on driver to view info

Navigators need to be able to:
- Indicate a rider has been picked up/dropped off
   - app should notify dispatcher web portal
- Text dispatcher
